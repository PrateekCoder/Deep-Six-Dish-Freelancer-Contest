##Contest Brief:

My company is a satellite dish removal company we remove satellite dishes from customers homes who no longer have directv or dish network or any satellite service they formally had . There are companies that do this but they are not brands they are not national names and thier websites are dull and boring and none in my area ( Houston ,TX ) the 4th largest city in the US !!

I want a landing page to generate leads . there is a company dish disposal that has pretty much all the written contentent you can use on my page . but i want mine to be better i want to build a brand something the public will know when they see it ( http://www.dishdisposal.com/ ) is the site that you can take some text elements from to give you a idea for the service we provide 



things to highlight 
- 49.99 price ( price for standard satellite dish removal ) 
- Anytime scheduling ( customer does not have to take time off for a appointment we complete the job and send them a notification when complete) .
- 24-48 hour guaranteed service completion .

note my prices right now the lowest in the market we charge 49.99 to remove any standard satellite tv dish the competition charges $150 !!

i want high quality images on my page not like dishdisposal they have the worst low quality pics .
